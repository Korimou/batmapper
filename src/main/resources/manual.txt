Welcome to batUtils.

	Version 1.0 Bat Utils. 
- batMapper plugin has been renamed to batUtils to better reflect the current and future status of it. I will be using this same plugin to put in more functionality in the future. 
- All data/notes below is still accurate and the versions are there for historical reasons.

	Version 1.4: Corpsehandler
- Click on Corpses tab to access the new corpsehandler. Basically what it does is it sets up your rip_action command. 
- The list in the lower right corner is a list of things that will be picked up from corpse or ground with the 'loot' selections. You can put for instance 'all gem' on on line to pick up all gems or gold,platinum on another line to pick up those. 
- Rest should be pretty self-evident, feel free to ask Glaurung for help if there is trouble related to it.


	Hotfix version 1.31:
- Doubleclick on exit to edit name and pressing esc to cancel no longer deletes the exit.

	Changes in 1.3 version:

- Removing exits, doubleclick on an exit to rename, empty name will remove it.
- Resizing mapwindow will also resize notes window.
- Map files are saved in batclient/conf/batMapAreas/, plugin will migrate files from old location.
- Map window now saves size and location between sessions.
- Buttons for dragging and selecting rooms have been reversed to be more consistant with the rest of the world!
- Mapwindow components now have mouseover tooltips.
- This builtin manual.
- Room can now be colored, click to select room and use coloring dropdown to change it. WTF why? Well, If you wish to highlight a room for blockers, desters, good loot, sexy beasts, you can.


	Saving maps
	
The map will save when you exit the area, or when you type save. ( well, actually, when "SAVED." appears as a new line). If you run into an area you haven't mapped before, and quit the batclient before exiting/saving, your map will be lost.

The room layout is saved as well, so feel free to adjust to your liking.

	The layout

The big part is the mapper, the right side has the room descs and exits. The lowest part is for your notes, if you wish to add them. To add notes, just click onthe room you want to add the notes to, and write in the lowermost box. 
The green rooms are outside rooms, the grey rooms are inside.
A red star in a room means that there is some non-compass-dir exit, ie, up, down, enter fireplace.
Only exits you use will be added into the map as links between rooms. Exits used and exits visible in "exits" will be drawn into the room icon.
	
	
	Controls
	
Cyan rim around a room is the selected one. Shift click on a room to add/remove it to/from selected rooms.
Right button drag can select an area of rooms.
Right-click on room to prompt for deletion of selecteds.
Right click on exit to prompt for deletion.
Red rim around a room is where you currently are, move to another room to change this.
If you have selected the room you are in ( ie, cyan and red rims) the selection will move with you.

- Doubleclicking on an exit between rooms will allow you to change it, ie: from enter -> enter fireplace.
- Clicking and dragging a room will move that room around, the exits will adjust. 
- Dragging the background will allow you to move the whole map around.
- Mouse scrolling will zoom in and out
- Click and drag ( rightclick ) on the background will allow you to make a selection of rooms, these can then be moved around together.
- Select a room and change the coloring from the coloring dropdown ( says normal if no color) to change the color of that maproom.
	
	Common WTF?!?!?!?!
	
Only room in compassdirs can be placed sensibly, therefore exits with u,d,enter fireplace, float northwest etc are placed badly by the mapper. You should move them to a place which makes sense to you before continuing onward in the area. 

Sometimes rooms will be placed ontop of eachother, the program notices, and places them partially ontop of eachother, you should be able to figure out where the rooms shall go and move them there.

In some area ( arelium, skeep, tyr farwyn) everything ends up getting messed up. This is a feature, I'm sorry about this. Once a proper fix is figured out, something will probably be done about it.

Aww damn I messed up my map, its a messy garble, I'd rather start from scratch! - Its fine, just move away from the area, find the mapfile in your filesystem, and delete it. The .batmap files are placed in a directory called batMapArea, they are named by some ingame name for the area. The directory is created under plugins directory under batclient installation.

Hey man, why you update so rarely? come on! - I'm currently very limited in my time with 3 young kids, I also wanna play the game too.

	Known issues

Yes, tyr farwyn, arelium are known issues, will try to figure out something to do about it.
