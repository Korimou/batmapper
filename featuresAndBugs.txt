Requested
- do something about the exit tags, they are not visible enough, maybe
- Add a button to programatically place the rooms again, incase I have accidentally messed up, maybe(redo layout thing)
- make special exits a different color perhaps, sure why not, maybe up and down arrows or something?
- make minimize button work, same as realm map, need to investigate
- make it save zoomlevel too
- make the manual better, html or rst or something better
